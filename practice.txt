Pseudoecode 1 - print a user-input into all caps, print the result:

Start

Declare string variable called inputString

inputString = User Input
Set inputString to upper case (Ignore special characters and digits)

Print capitalized inputString to the user

End


Pseudocode 2 - have a user input two numbers, add them together and print the result:

Start

Declare integer called numOne
Declare integer called numTwo

Print prompt for user input for numOne
  numOne = User Input (Only numbers)
Print prompt for user input for numTwo
  numTwo = User Input (Only numbers)

Print result ( numOne + numTwo ) to the user

End

Pseudocode 3 - Get an unknown amount of numbers from the user and add them together, print out the result:

Start

Declare double totalNum
Declare bool finished

While not finished
  Print prompt for user to enter a number to add to the running total
  totalNum += User Input (Only numbers)

  Print new total (totalNum)

  Print prompt to decide if the user is finished
  finished = User Input (Decided if user enters Y/N)

  exit if the user is finished

End

Pseudocode 4 - Have the user define a maximum whole number, print out a random number between 0 and their number. Allow the user to play again or quit:

Start

Declare integer maxNum
Declare integer randomInt

While not finished
  Print prompt for user to enter a new max number
  maxNum = User Input (Only numbers)

  randomInt = get random integer (between 0 and maxNum)

  Print randomInt back to the user
  Print prompt to decide if the user is finihsed
  finished = User Input (Decided if user enters Y/N, asks them if they'd like to play again)

  exit if the user is finished

End

Pseudocode 5 - Get a random number. If the number is event print "RIGHT", if it's odd, print "LEFT". Do this ten times. Print out how many times it was "LEFT" and how many times it was "RIGHT":

Start

Declare integer called totalLeft
Declare integer called totalRight
Declare integer called randomNum

For Loop 10 times:
  randomNum = randomInteger (Between 1 and 100)

  Print randomNum to the user

  If randomNum % 2 = 0 (Checks if even)
    increment totalRight
  Else (If not even, then odd)
    increment totalLeft

For loop finished

Print totalRight to the user
Print totalLeft to the user

End
